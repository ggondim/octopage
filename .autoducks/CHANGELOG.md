## [0.5.4] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- fix(agent): honour surface: both, and stop double-posting refusals (#1170)

## [0.5.3] - 2026-08-02

### Security
- The custom-agent lane now reads agent definitions — and the `custom_agents`
  config keys that grant them tools — from the base branch, never from the
  checked-out tree. On a pull request the checkout is `refs/pull/N/head`, and a
  definition body becomes the agent's prompt, so the previous behaviour could
  execute unreviewed content with the repository's token. This applies to both
  discovery and prompt assembly. (#1168)

### Changed
- **Behaviour change for `/agent`:** a definition that exists only on a pull
  request is no longer discovered, so an agent cannot be tried from the pull
  request that introduces it. Merge the definition to the default branch first,
  then use it. A `/agent` run on a pull request still works and still takes that
  pull request as its context; only the definition comes from elsewhere. (#1168)
- Removed the machinery this replaces: the `verified` descriptor field, the tool
  clamp and its `unverified_tools` floor, the unverified-definition refusal, and
  the `custom_agents.allow_unverified` opt-in. None of these were part of a
  release, so no configuration needs migrating. (#1168)

## [0.5.2] - 2026-08-02

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- Documented the `agent` lane in `.autoducks/design/AGENTS.md`: the `/agent
  <name>` positional command surface (including that `/agent sonnet` looks up
  an agent named `sonnet` rather than the `sonnet` model alias, and that a
  bare `/agent` posts the catalog), the new "Agent Lane" section among the
  utility agents, the `Agent:running`/`Agent:done` label pair, the
  `agent/<name>/<issue>-<slug>` branch namespace, and the
  `.autoducks/agents/agent/` directory entry alongside `discover-agents.sh`
  and `interpolate-artifacts.sh`.

**Update note:** every `autoducks.json` key the `agent` lane itself reads is
optional and inert when absent, so the `agent` lane contributes no migration
of its own for this version boundary (the `migrations/0.2.0/migrate.sh` that
ships in this release is unrelated — it back-fills the `update` config block
for the Update agent). Consuming repos do need one `scripts/install.sh` run,
one `update-triggers.sh` run, or one Update-agent pass to bake the `/agent`
trigger word into their workflow guards before `/agent` will respond — but
that pass is a one-time cost for the whole custom-agent lane, not something
repeated per custom agent added afterward.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added
- Versioning substrate: `.autoducks/VERSION`, `.autoducks/CHANGELOG.md`, the
  shared `semver.sh` module, and the `changelog.sh` parser. The plugin
  `autoducksVersion` compat gate in `apply-plugins.sh` now reads a live host
  version from `.autoducks/VERSION` instead of staying advisory-only.
