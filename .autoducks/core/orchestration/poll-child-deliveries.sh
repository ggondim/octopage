# Poll each protected metarepo child's delivery PR to completion, driving the
# AUTODUCKS_DELIVERY_CHECK_NAME check-run on the parent's final PR. Inert
# outside metarepo mode (byte-identical single-repo behavior).
#
# Never merges a child and never comments. Two bounded, idempotent side effects
# beyond the check-run (start/conclude) exist because nothing else in the
# pipeline was in a position to perform them (#119):
#
#   * a draft→ready toggle on a child delivery PR that has NO check runs at all,
#     to re-fire a required check whose triggering event GitHub dropped;
#   * a gitlink-only commit on the parent PR's own head branch, re-pointing each
#     child at its current default-branch tip.
#
# Both are derived from current remote state, so a re-run (e.g. on `synchronize`)
# simply re-derives them; there is no workflow-local cache to go stale.
#
# Required env: REPO (parent slug), PR_NUM (parent's final PR number),
# PR_HEAD_SHA (github.event.pull_request.head.sha) — the check-run is
# attached to this commit. The affected children and the feature-branch name
# used to find each child's delivery PR are both re-derived from the PR
# itself (git::get_pr), not trusted from a possibly-stale event payload.

# ── Gitlink reconciliation (#119a/b) ──────────────────────────────────────
# Before gating on the children, make sure the gitlinks this PR carries still
# describe where those children actually are. A pin goes stale two ways that
# nothing else notices: an async auto-merge delivery could not report the SHA it
# would produce, and a sibling parent PR merging moves the base's gitlink out
# from under this one. Either leaves a 3-way conflict on an opaque SHA, so a PR
# that was MERGEABLE at creation silently turns CONFLICTING.
#
# Only fast-forwards are applied (metarepo::reconcile_gitlinks refuses anything
# else). A reconcile commit changes this PR's head, so the check-run created
# below is anchored on a SHA that is no longer the tip — conclude_all() therefore
# mirrors the conclusion onto the new head too, which keeps the required check
# satisfied even when the push credential is a GITHUB_TOKEN that fires no
# `synchronize` event.

# the branch holding it had been deleted — and this check reported SUCCESS the
# whole time, because it read the child PR's *state* and never the SHA.

# child was advanced synchronously, which makes its pin *likely* reachable, not
# reachable — the branch can still be gone by the time the parent merges.
