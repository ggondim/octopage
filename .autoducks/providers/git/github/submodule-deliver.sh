# git::submodule_deliver(path, child_branch) — merge-time delivery for one child,
# run by Maestro *before* the parent merges (HANDOFF push order + retention).
# All API calls use the child's resolved credential, never the global GH_TOKEN.
#
# The parent gitlink pins the child *feature-branch* HEAD (Y). Delivery integrates
# Y into the child's default branch, honoring the configured merge method:
#
#   fast-forward / merge commit → Y stays reachable from the default branch
#                                  (FF makes main==Y; merge makes Y an ancestor),
#                                  so the pin needs no change.
#   squash / rebase            → the child's history is rewritten to a NEW commit
#                                  S (Y is not an ancestor of S). To keep the pin
#                                  valid the parent gitlink must be RE-POINTED to S
#                                  — the caller (deliver_children) does that, then
#                                  deletes the now-unreferenced feature branch.
#
# Honors AUTODUCKS_MERGE_METHOD (merge|squash|rebase|auto). "auto" prefers a merge
# commit for children (SHA-preserving → no re-pin), falling back to whatever the
# child repo allows.
#
# STDOUT contract (single line):
#   "<pin_sha> <needs_repin:0|1> <needs_resolve:0|1> <child_pr_num>"
#   pin_sha       = the SHA the parent gitlink should point at after delivery
#   needs_repin   = 1 when the SHA was rewritten (squash/rebase) and the feature
#                   branch was RETAINED for safety (caller must re-pin, then delete it)
#   needs_resolve = 1 when a protected child's delivery PR is CONFLICTING (or
#                   persistently behind its base) — the PR is left open, UNMERGED,
#                   and child_pr_num names it so the caller (deliver_children) can
#                   run the resolver on it. Defaults to 0 on every other path.
#   child_pr_num  = the child delivery PR number when needs_resolve=1, else empty.
# All human-facing notices go to stderr. Offline children print "" and return 0.
